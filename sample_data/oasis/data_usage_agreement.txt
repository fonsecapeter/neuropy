OASIS Data Usage Agreement (DUA)
--------------------------------

The Open Access Structural Imaging Series (OASIS) is a project
dedicated to making brain imaging data openly available to the public.

Using data available through the OASIS project requires agreeing with
the following:

    1. The quality and completeness of the data cannot be
       guaranteed. Users employ these data at their own risk.

    2. Users shall respect restrictions of access to sensitive
       data. Users will make no attempt to identify the individuals whose
       images are included in OASIS data sets.  Users must acknowledge
       the use of OASIS data and data derived from OASIS data when
       publicly presenting any findings or algorithms that benefited from
       their use. Such presentations include but are not limited to
       papers, books, book chapters, conference posters, and talks.

    3. When publishing findings that benefit from OASIS data, please
       include the following grant numbers in the acknowledgements
       section and in the associated Pubmed Central submission: P50
       AG05681, P01 AG03991, R01 AG021910, P20 MH071616, U24 RR021382.

    4. Redistribution of original OASIS data is permitted so long as
       the data are redistributed under the same terms and conditions are
       described in this DUA.
      
    5. Data derived from original OASIS data may be distributed under
       terms and conditions established by the creators of the
       data. Users must comply with the terms and conditions of use set
       by the creators of the data.
